# General info
First self made aplication in ReactJS technology. The main foundation was to create a working App based on SpaceX API. Aplication is aimed to present as much information as possible about SpaceX company. A simple layout made by hand outside the landing page, which was modeled on the design found on pinterest. I specially send big thank to SpaceX API creators for the possibility of using it in my own project.

## Technologies
Project is created with: 
* HTML5
* CSS 3
* ReactJS
* [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)
* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) 2.24.0

## Sources
* [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)
* The Martian movie

## Inspiration
The inspiration to made that app is my interest of space and development of space technology. The main inspiration to create it was SpaceX company and its activities.

## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
